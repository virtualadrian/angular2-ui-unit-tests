# angular2-ui-unit-tests


**Description:**

Found these on the documentation site one day and then they started to 404 the next. I forked the Plunker to keep
the examples alive, and then and moved the code so it could be cloned into an IDE. 

**Plan:**

As time allows this should grow into an example application that contains all features an enterprise application may demand.

**Where Are The Plunks:**

- Plunker For the Well Tested Application: **[https://plnkr.co/pcgXD9](http://plnkr.co/pcgXD9)**
- Plunker For the Swiss Army Knife/Grab Bag: **[https://plnkr.co/aeAbjoUnHbMaPEbascZ5](https://plnkr.co/aeAbjoUnHbMaPEbascZ5)**


**Roadmap:**

Moving forward I will create an application that will serve as a front end to a sample database like Northwind.
